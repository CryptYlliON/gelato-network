# What is Gelato?üç¶

Gelato is a tool that enables web3 developers to build fully automated dapps on Ethereum. Think of Gelato as enabling you to use `If This, Then That` for smart contracts. It allows for the combination of arbitrary conditions with arbitrary actions on-chain, which will be executed on behalf of your users by a network of relay nodes.

Developers, you can use gelato to build out cool end-user products, such as limit orders on DEXs or automated interest rate refinancing using multiple lending protocols, without worrying about having to run & maintain the required infrastructure.

# What does this repo contain?

It contains the Gelato core protocol and examples of condition, action & provider smart contracts. This repo uses @nomiclabs/buidler and ethers.js.

# Want to build a condition and action on top of gelato?
