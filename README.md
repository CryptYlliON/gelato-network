# What is gelato?
Think of gelato as `If This, Then That` for smart contracts. It allows for the combination of arbitrary conditions with arbitrary actions on-chain. Gelato is designed and run for developers.

Use gelato to build out cool end-user products, such as limit orders on DEXs or automated interest rate refinancing using multiple lending protocols.

# What does this repo contain?
It contains the gelato protocol, condition and action smart contracts and uses @nomiclabs/buidler and ethers.js.
