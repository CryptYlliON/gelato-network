# What is gelato?
Think of gelato as If This, Then That for smart contracts. It allows for the combination of arbitrary triggers with arbitrary actions. Designed and run for developers. Use gelato to build out cool end-user products, such as limit orders on DEXs or automated Interest Rate refinancing dapps using multiple lending protocols.

# What does this repo contain?
This Repo containts the smart contracts and uses OpenZeppelin SDK and ethers.js.
