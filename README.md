# What is gelato?
Think of gelato as `If This, Then That` for smart contracts. It allows for the combination of arbitrary conditions with arbitrary actions on-chain. Gelato is designed and run for developers.

Use gelato to build out cool end-user products, such as limit orders on DEXs or automated interest rate refinancing using multiple lending protocols.

# What does this repo contain?
It containts the smart contracts and uses OpenZeppelin SDK and ethers.js.

# Want to build a condition and action on top of gelato?
